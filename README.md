# Hmong:English Translator

Hello my name is Sue Vang and I am Hmong. 

This is my personal project to create a simple Hmong to English (vice versa) translator for anyone interested to learn
a Hmong word or two (or English). The colon is used in the page title (Hmong:English) to show the portion or the key bind
to its value. (i.e key : value => hello : nyob zoo).
